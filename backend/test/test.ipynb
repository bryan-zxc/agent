      "Auckland Airport is in the midst of a significant multi-billion dollar redevelopment program, with several major projects underway in 2024 aimed at enhancing passenger experience, increasing capacity, and improving resilience. The centerpiece of this transformation is the construction of a new domestic terminal integrated with the existing international terminal.\n",
      "\n",
      "### New Integrated Domestic Terminal\n",
      "\n",
      "Auckland Airport is investing approximately NZ$3.9 billion to construct a new domestic terminal and integrate it with the international terminal. This will eliminate the current need for travelers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals, creating a seamless five-minute indoor connection.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key features and benefits of the new terminal include:**\n",
      "*   **Increased Capacity:** The new terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 44% increase in customer processing capacity. It will also provide a 26% increase in airline seat capacity, with an additional 10% of flexible capacity through bus lounge operations.\n",
      "*   **Modernized Facilities:** Travelers can expect modern amenities including more seating with charging points, improved bathroom facilities, and enhanced retail and dining options. The new terminal will also feature check-in kiosks and automatic bag drops, with the capability for future biometric technology upgrades.\n",
      "*   **Improved Baggage System:** A new individual carrier system (ICS) for baggage handling is being implemented, which is faster and less prone to jamming than traditional conveyor belts. There will also be a 70% increase in baggage reclaim space.\n",
      "*   **Sustainability Focus:** The project aims to reduce embodied carbon and achieve a 30% decrease in operational emissions through features like all-electric heating and cooling systems and the use of low-carbon materials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Construction and Timeline:**\n",
      "*   Vertical construction on the new domestic jet terminal began in early 2024, with steel columns being erected.\n",
      "*   As of May 2024, 20% of the work on the terminal integration was complete, with 35% in the delivery phase.\n",
      "*   The new integrated terminal is expected to be completed and open to the public between 2028 and 2029.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Other Major Projects\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the new terminal, Auckland Airport is also advancing other key infrastructure projects:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Transport Hub:** The first stage of a new Transport Hub was nearing completion and expected to open in April 2024. This four-story structure will serve as a new entrance and departure point for travelers, offering a covered pick-up and drop-off area and a landscaped pedestrian plaza. It will also feature a large solar array to help power the facility.\n",
      "*   **Airfield Expansion:** A major expansion of the airfield is underway to build greater resilience. This includes the construction of seven new remote stands for international aircraft and the installation of 3,500 meters of new stormwater pipes to protect against extreme weather events. This project is on track for completion in late 2025.\n",

      "The significant investment has led to an increase in airport charges. Domestic flight charges are set to increase from NZ$10.25 per passenger to $15.45 by 2027. This has drawn criticism from airlines like Air New Zealand, who have expressed concerns about the rising costs for passengers. However, Auckland Airport maintains that the development is necessary to modernize the aging domestic terminal, which dates back to the 1960s, and to future-proof the airport. A survey conducted by the airport indicated that 76% of passengers believe the development is necessary.\n",

The centerpiece of this transformation is the construction of a new domestic terminal integrated with the existing international terminal.\\n\\n### New Integrated Domestic Terminal\\n\\nAuckland Airport is investing approximately NZ$3.9 billion to construct a new domestic terminal and integrate it with the international terminal. This will eliminate the current need for travelers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals, creating a seamless five-minute indoor connection.\\n\\n**Key features and benefits of the new terminal include:**\\n*   **Increased Capacity:** The new terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 44% increase in customer processing capacity. It will also provide a 26% increase in airline seat capacity, with an additional 10% of flexible capacity through bus lounge operations.\\n*   **Modernized Facilities:** Travelers can expect modern amenities including more seating with charging points, improved bathroom facilities, and enhanced retail and dining options. The new terminal will also feature check-in kiosks and automatic bag drops, with the capability for future biometric technology upgrades.\\n*   **Improved Baggage System:** A new individual carrier system (ICS) for baggage handling is being implemented, which is faster and less prone to jamming than traditional conveyor belts. There will also be a 70% increase in baggage reclaim space.\\n*   **Sustainability Focus:** The project aims to reduce embodied carbon and achieve a 30% decrease in operational emissions through features like all-electric heating and cooling systems and the use of low-carbon materials.\\n\\n**Construction and Timeline:**\\n*   Vertical construction on the new domestic jet terminal began in early 2024, with steel columns being erected.\\n*   As of May 2024, 20% of the work on the terminal integration was complete, with 35% in the delivery phase.\\n*   The new integrated terminal is expected to be completed and open to the public between 2028 and 2029.\\n\\n### Other Major Projects\\n\\nBeyond the new terminal, Auckland Airport is also advancing other key infrastructure projects:\\n\\n*   **Transport Hub:** The first stage of a new Transport Hub was nearing completion and expected to open in April 2024. This four-story structure will serve as a new entrance and departure point for travelers, offering a covered pick-up and drop-off area and a landscaped pedestrian plaza. It will also feature a large solar array to help power the facility.\\n*   **Airfield Expansion:** A major expansion of the airfield is underway to build greater resilience. This includes the construction of seven new remote stands for international aircraft and the installation of 3,500 meters of new stormwater pipes to protect against extreme weather events. This project is on track for completion in late 2025.\\n\\n### Passenger Impact and Airline Response\\n\\nThe extensive construction will cause disruption for the 18 to 20 million travelers who use the airport annually. Auckland Airport has acknowledged this and is working to minimize the impact.\\n\\nThe significant investment has led to an increase in airport charges. Domestic flight charges are set to increase from NZ$10.25 per passenger to $15.45 by 2027. This has drawn criticism from airlines like Air New Zealand, who have expressed concerns about the rising costs for passengers. However, Auckland Airport maintains that the development is necessary to modernize the aging domestic terminal, which dates back to the 1960s, and to future-proof the airport. A survey conducted by the airport indicated that 76% of passengers believe the development is necessary.\\n```\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You may use the following function(s):\\n\\n# search_web_general\\n\\nSearches the web using Google Search.\\nDo not use this function for document search, use `search_web_pdf` instead.\\n\\nParameters:\\n----------\\nquery : str\\n    The search query or question to be answered using web search results.\\n\\nReturns:\\n-------\\nstr\\n    Web search results.\\n\\n\\nWhen using the function(s) you can assume that they already exists in the environment, to use it, simply call the function with the required parameters.

The centerpiece of this transformation is the construction of a new domestic terminal integrated with the existing international terminal.\\n\\n### New Integrated Domestic Terminal\\n\\nAuckland Airport is investing approximately NZ$3.9 billion to construct a new domestic terminal and integrate it with the international terminal. This will eliminate the current need for travelers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals, creating a seamless five-minute indoor connection.\\n\\n**Key features and benefits of the new terminal include:**\\n*   **Increased Capacity:** The new terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 44% increase in customer processing capacity. It will also provide a 26% increase in airline seat capacity, with an additional 10% of flexible capacity through bus lounge operations.\\n*   **Modernized Facilities:** Travelers can expect modern amenities including more seating with charging points, improved bathroom facilities, and enhanced retail and dining options. The new terminal will also feature check-in kiosks and automatic bag drops, with the capability for future biometric technology upgrades.\\n*   **Improved Baggage System:** A new individual carrier system (ICS) for baggage handling is being implemented, which is faster and less prone to jamming than traditional conveyor belts. There will also be a 70% increase in baggage reclaim space.\\n*   **Sustainability Focus:** The project aims to reduce embodied carbon and achieve a 30% decrease in operational emissions through features like all-electric heating and cooling systems and the use of low-carbon materials.\\n\\n**Construction and Timeline:**\\n*   Vertical construction on the new domestic jet terminal began in early 2024, with steel columns being erected.\\n*   As of May 2024, 20% of the work on the terminal integration was complete, with 35% in the delivery phase.\\n*   The new integrated terminal is expected to be completed and open to the public between 2028 and 2029.\\n\\n### Other Major Projects\\n\\nBeyond the new terminal, Auckland Airport is also advancing other key infrastructure projects:\\n\\n*   **Transport Hub:** The first stage of a new Transport Hub was nearing completion and expected to open in April 2024. This four-story structure will serve as a new entrance and departure point for travelers, offering a covered pick-up and drop-off area and a landscaped pedestrian plaza. It will also feature a large solar array to help power the facility.\\n*   **Airfield Expansion:** A major expansion of the airfield is underway to build greater resilience. This includes the construction of seven new remote stands for international aircraft and the installation of 3,500 meters of new stormwater pipes to protect against extreme weather events. This project is on track for completion in late 2025.\\n\\n### Passenger Impact and Airline Response\\n\\nThe extensive construction will cause disruption for the 18 to 20 million travelers who use the airport annually. Auckland Airport has acknowledged this and is working to minimize the impact.\\n\\nThe significant investment has led to an increase in airport charges. Domestic flight charges are set to increase from NZ$10.25 per passenger to $15.45 by 2027. This has drawn criticism from airlines like Air New Zealand, who have expressed concerns about the rising costs for passengers. However, Auckland Airport maintains that the development is necessary to modernize the aging domestic terminal, which dates back to the 1960s, and to future-proof the airport. A survey conducted by the airport indicated that 76% of passengers believe the development is necessary.\\n```\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You may use the following function(s):\\n\\n# search_web_general\\n\\nSearches the web using Google Search.\\nDo not use this function for document search, use `search_web_pdf` instead.\\n\\nParameters:\\n----------\\nquery : str\\n    The search query or question to be answered using web search results.\\n\\nReturns:\\n-------\\nstr\\n    Web search results.\\n\\n\\nWhen using the function(s) you can assume that they already exists in the environment, to use it, simply call the function with the required parameters.

This will eliminate the current need for travelers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals, creating a seamless five-minute indoor connection.\\n\\n**Key features and benefits of the new terminal include:**\\n*   **Increased Capacity:** The new terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 44% increase in customer processing capacity. It will also provide a 26% increase in airline seat capacity, with an additional 10% of flexible capacity through bus lounge operations.\\n*   **Modernized Facilities:** Travelers can expect modern amenities including more seating with charging points, improved bathroom facilities, and enhanced retail and dining options. The new terminal will also feature check-in kiosks and automatic bag drops, with the capability for future biometric technology upgrades.\\n*   **Improved Baggage System:** A new individual carrier system (ICS) for baggage handling is being implemented, which is faster and less prone to jamming than traditional conveyor belts. There will also be a 70% increase in baggage reclaim space.\\n*   **Sustainability Focus:** The project aims to reduce embodied carbon and achieve a 30% decrease in operational emissions through features like all-electric heating and cooling systems and the use of low-carbon materials.\\n\\n**Construction and Timeline:**\\n*   Vertical construction on the new domestic jet terminal began in early 2024, with steel columns being erected.\\n*   As of May 2024, 20% of the work on the terminal integration was complete, with 35% in the delivery phase.\\n*   The new integrated terminal is expected to be completed and open to the public between 2028 and 2029.\\n\\n### Other Major Projects\\n\\nBeyond the new terminal, Auckland Airport is also advancing other key infrastructure projects:\\n\\n*   **Transport Hub:** The first stage of a new Transport Hub was nearing completion and expected to open in April 2024. This four-story structure will serve as a new entrance and departure point for travelers, offering a covered pick-up and drop-off area and a landscaped pedestrian plaza. It will also feature a large solar array to help power the facility.\\n*   **Airfield Expansion:** A major expansion of the airfield is underway to build greater resilience. This includes the construction of seven new remote stands for international aircraft and the installation of 3,500 meters of new stormwater pipes to protect against extreme weather events. This project is on track for completion in late 2025.\\n\\n### Passenger Impact and Airline Response\\n\\nThe extensive construction will cause disruption for the 18 to 20 million travelers who use the airport annually. Auckland Airport has acknowledged this and is working to minimize the impact.\\n\\nThe significant investment has led to an increase in airport charges. Domestic flight charges are set to increase from NZ$10.25 per passenger to $15.45 by 2027. This has drawn criticism from airlines like Air New Zealand, who have expressed concerns about the rising costs for passengers. However, Auckland Airport maintains that the development is necessary to modernize the aging domestic terminal, which dates back to the 1960s, and to future-proof the airport. A survey conducted by the airport indicated that 76% of passengers believe the development is necessary.\\n```\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You may use the following function(s):\\n\\n# search_web_general\\n\\nSearches the web using Google Search.\\nDo not use this function for document search, use `search_web_pdf` instead.\\n\\nParameters:\\n----------\\nquery : str\\n    The search query or question to be answered using web search results.\\n\\nReturns:\\n-------\\nstr\\n    Web search results.\\n\\n\\nWhen using the function(s) you can assume that they already exists in the environment, to use it, simply call the function with the required parameters.

      "\n",
      "Auckland Airport is currently undergoing a significant multi-billion dollar redevelopment program aimed at modernizing its facilities, enhancing passenger experience, and preparing for future growth. The cornerstone of this ambitious undertaking is the construction of a new integrated domestic terminal, alongside major upgrades to the airfield and transport network.\n",
      "\n",
      "The existing domestic terminal, which has been in operation for nearly 60 years, is set to be replaced by a new $2.2 billion facility. This new terminal will be integrated with the international terminal, allowing for a seamless five-minute indoor walk between domestic and international flights. This will eliminate the current need for passengers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals. Construction of the new terminal is scheduled to begin later in 2024, with an expected completion date between 2028 and 2029.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new domestic terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 26% increase in capacity. It will feature 12 jet aircraft gates, state-of-the-art baggage reclaim systems with 70% more space, and enhanced passenger amenities, including more seating with device charging points and improved bathroom facilities.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to the new terminal, the airport is also expanding its airfield. This includes the construction of new taxiways and six remote stands for aircraft. These upgrades are intended to increase airfield capacity and efficiency, with completion expected in late 2025.\n",
      "\n",
      "The airport's transport hub is also being upgraded to improve access and reduce congestion. The first stage of the new Transport Hub, located on the ground floor of the international terminal, opened in April 2024.\n",
      "\n",
      "The entire redevelopment program is a massive undertaking, with an estimated cost of $3.9 billion for the terminal integration alone. While the project promises a significantly improved travel experience, it will also cause some disruption for travelers over the next five years. Auckland Airport has stated that it is working to minimize these disruptions as much as possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "A recent survey of over 600 travelers indicated strong public support for the redevelopment, with 76% stating that the development is necessary and 81% supporting investment to future-proof the airport against weather events. As of May 2024, 20% of the integrated terminal works were complete, with 35% of the project in the delivery phase.\n",

The centerpiece of this transformation is the construction of a new domestic terminal integrated with the existing international terminal.\\n\\n### New Integrated Domestic Terminal\\n\\nAuckland Airport is investing approximately NZ$3.9 billion to construct a new domestic terminal and integrate it with the international terminal. This will eliminate the current need for travelers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals, creating a seamless five-minute indoor connection.\\n\\n**Key features and benefits of the new terminal include:**\\n*   **Increased Capacity:** The new terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 44% increase in customer processing capacity. It will also provide a 26% increase in airline seat capacity, with an additional 10% of flexible capacity through bus lounge operations.\\n*   **Modernized Facilities:** Travelers can expect modern amenities including more seating with charging points, improved bathroom facilities, and enhanced retail and dining options. The new terminal will also feature check-in kiosks and automatic bag drops, with the capability for future biometric technology upgrades.\\n*   **Improved Baggage System:** A new individual carrier system (ICS) for baggage handling is being implemented, which is faster and less prone to jamming than traditional conveyor belts. There will also be a 70% increase in baggage reclaim space.\\n*   **Sustainability Focus:** The project aims to reduce embodied carbon and achieve a 30% decrease in operational emissions through features like all-electric heating and cooling systems and the use of low-carbon materials.\\n\\n**Construction and Timeline:**\\n*   Vertical construction on the new domestic jet terminal began in early 2024, with steel columns being erected.\\n*   As of May 2024, 20% of the work on the terminal integration was complete, with 35% in the delivery phase.\\n*   The new integrated terminal is expected to be completed and open to the public between 2028 and 2029.\\n\\n### Other Major Projects\\n\\nBeyond the new terminal, Auckland Airport is also advancing other key infrastructure projects:\\n\\n*   **Transport Hub:** The first stage of a new Transport Hub was nearing completion and expected to open in April 2024. This four-story structure will serve as a new entrance and departure point for travelers, offering a covered pick-up and drop-off area and a landscaped pedestrian plaza. It will also feature a large solar array to help power the facility.\\n*   **Airfield Expansion:** A major expansion of the airfield is underway to build greater resilience. This includes the construction of seven new remote stands for international aircraft and the installation of 3,500 meters of new stormwater pipes to protect against extreme weather events. This project is on track for completion in late 2025.\\n\\n### Passenger Impact and Airline Response\\n\\nThe extensive construction will cause disruption for the 18 to 20 million travelers who use the airport annually. Auckland Airport has acknowledged this and is working to minimize the impact.\\n\\nThe significant investment has led to an increase in airport charges. Domestic flight charges are set to increase from NZ$10.25 per passenger to $15.45 by 2027. This has drawn criticism from airlines like Air New Zealand, who have expressed concerns about the rising costs for passengers. However, Auckland Airport maintains that the development is necessary to modernize the aging domestic terminal, which dates back to the 1960s, and to future-proof the airport. A survey conducted by the airport indicated that 76% of passengers believe the development is necessary.\\n```\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'You may use the following function(s):\\n\\n# search_web_general\\n\\nSearches the web using Google Search.\\nDo not use this function for document search, use `search_web_pdf` instead.\\n\\nParameters:\\n----------\\nquery : str\\n    The search query or question to be answered using web search results.\\n\\nReturns:\\n-------\\nstr\\n    Web search results.\\n\\n\\nWhen using the function(s) you can assume that they already exists in the environment, to use it, simply call the function with the required parameters.

The cornerstone of this ambitious undertaking is the construction of a new integrated domestic terminal, alongside major upgrades to the airfield and transport network.\\n\\nThe existing domestic terminal, which has been in operation for nearly 60 years, is set to be replaced by a new $2.2 billion facility. This new terminal will be integrated with the international terminal, allowing for a seamless five-minute indoor walk between domestic and international flights. This will eliminate the current need for passengers to walk outdoors or take a bus between the two terminals. Construction of the new terminal is scheduled to begin later in 2024, with an expected completion date between 2028 and 2029.\\n\\nThe new domestic terminal is designed to handle up to 20,000 passengers a day, a 26% increase in capacity. It will feature 12 jet aircraft gates, state-of-the-art baggage reclaim systems with 70% more space, and enhanced passenger amenities, including more seating with device charging points and improved bathroom facilities.\\n\\nIn addition to the new terminal, the airport is also expanding its airfield. This includes the construction of new taxiways and six remote stands for aircraft. These upgrades are intended to increase airfield capacity and efficiency, with completion expected in late 2025.\\n\\nThe airport's transport hub is also being upgraded to improve access and reduce congestion. The first stage of the new Transport Hub, located on the ground floor of the international terminal, opened in April 2024.\\n\\nThe entire redevelopment program is a massive undertaking, with an estimated cost of $3.9 billion for the terminal integration alone. While the project promises a significantly improved travel experience, it will also cause some disruption for travelers over the next five years. Auckland Airport has stated that it is working to minimize these disruptions as much as possible.\\n\\nA recent survey of over 600 travelers indicated strong public support for the redevelopment, with 76% stating that the development is necessary and 81% supporting investment to future-proof the airport against weather events. As of May 2024, 20% of the integrated terminal works were complete, with 35% of the project in the delivery phase.\\n```\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': \"Determine if the task is successfully completed based on the acceptance criteria:\\n['The search results contain recent and relevant information about Auckland Airport projects.', 'The information is comprehensive enough to answer questions about ongoing and upcoming projects.']\\n\\n\"}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Please respond with a JSON object that is compliant with this schema from the .model_json_schema() of a Pydantic model:\\n\\n{\\n  \"$defs\": {\\n    \"TaskResult\": {\\n      \"properties\": {\\n        \"result\": {\\n          \"default\": \"\",\\n          \"description\": \"A detailed summary of all the actions taken, and critical outcomes of the task.If the task was repeated failed with no change in the process, and then accepted as complete directly as a result of inconclusive repetitive failure, then explicitly state this.\",\\n          \"title\": \"Result\",\\n          \"type\": \"string\"\\n        },\\n        \"output\": {\\n          \"default\": \"\",\\n          \"description\": \"State every output and the actual content of the output.

These include a new integrated domestic terminal costing approximately NZ$3.9 billion, with construction starting in 2024 and expected to be completed between 2028 and 2029. This terminal will increase passenger capacity by 20%, add new jet gates, and feature modern facilities with a focus on sustainability. Additionally, the Transport Hub's first stage opened in April 2024, offering covered pick-up and drop-off areas and solar energy facilities. The airport is also expanding its airfield with new taxiways and remote stands, scheduled for completion in late 2025. These developments aim to enhance capacity, efficiency, and passenger experience at Auckland Airport.\n"

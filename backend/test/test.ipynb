       "\n",
       "Auckland Airport has released its annual report for the 2024 financial year, highlighting a significant recovery in international passenger numbers and a resulting surge in revenue. The report, covering the twelve months to June 30, 2024, details a year of robust growth as the aviation industry continues to bounce back from the impacts of the pandemic.\n",
       "\n",
       "The airport experienced a 17% increase in total passenger numbers, reaching 18.5 million. This growth was largely driven by a 29% jump in international passengers, which totaled 10.1 million for the year. Domestic passenger numbers also saw a healthy 5% increase to 8.5 million. This resurgence in travel led to a 43% rise in the airport's revenue, which climbed to $895.5 million.\n",
       "\n",
       "The strong return of international airlines and the introduction of new carriers and routes were key factors in this recovery. International seat availability reached approximately 91% of pre-pandemic (2019) levels. A notable area of growth was on North American routes, which saw a 48% increase in available seats, leading to a 40% rise in visitors from the region. Connectivity with China also improved, with six airlines now connecting Auckland to seven destinations in mainland China, surpassing pre-pandemic seat capacity by about 2%. In total, 27 airlines operated non-stop flights between Auckland and 42 international destinations in the 2024 financial year.\n",
       "\n",
       "Despite the strong revenue growth, the airport's reported profit after tax saw a significant 87% decrease to $5.5 million.\n",
       "\n",
       "Looking ahead, Auckland Airport will pay a final dividend of 6.5 cents per share on October 4, 2024. The company acknowledged that a full recovery to pre-2019 capacity levels may take longer due to global aircraft order backlogs and other ongoing challenges within the aviation industry.\n",
